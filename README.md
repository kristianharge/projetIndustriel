This code takes back the one used for Kilobots. blank.c is used by the kilobot owner,
it can be modified to choose the behaviour that the user wants to give it.

The file kilolib.c is the library file, it can be modified to change some of the basic functions
of the new kilobot.

To compile, you only neet to do a "make" or "make blank" in the folder containing the files.
Finally, you can use the kilobot bootloader or an isp connector to program the mini robot.
